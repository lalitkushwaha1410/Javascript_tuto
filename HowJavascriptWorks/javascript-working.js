// how javascript works ?

// there are 2 phases :
// 1. run time
// 2. compile time
// inside compile time , there are 2 phases : compilation and execution phase
// inside compilation phase, there are 3 phases : 1. tokenizing  2. parsing 3. code generation
// tokenizing - breaking the code into small pieces called tokens
// parsing - converting tokens into a tree called abstract syntax tree
// code generation - converting the tree into machine code

// why compile time : early error checking time

//2. Execution context : there is global exceution context
